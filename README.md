# STAT545-participation
Participation repo for the UBC class STAT 545A for Sean La for term Wnter 2019.

The folders in this repository contain the participation materials for each class meeting.
For example, folder `cm001` contains the participation materials from class meeting 1, `cm002` materials for class meeting 2, and so on. 

Here is a table which directs you to my various participation files, for those that require the output to be knitted to HTML.
